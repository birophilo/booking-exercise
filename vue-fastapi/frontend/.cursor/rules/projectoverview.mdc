# A Single Page App for booking appointments.

The application should provide a clean, efficient booking experience.

## Technology
- Use Vue.js for the frontend: Vue components with ES6 Javascipt
- Cal.com API integration for managing appointments and checking availability of time slots

## Routes
- booking page with calendar
- success confirmation page

## Calendar
For the cal.com calendar, either use an embedded cal.com widget, or use the cal.com API and make the calendar with Vue components. The calendar should have:
- A date picker
- A selection of time slots for each date
- Unavailable slots are greyed out/disabled. This will require integration with Cal.com API to fetch availability
- Booking form contains name and email fields

## Confirmation
- Success page after booking
